 <p>

 <p>I am looking for my next challenge, my next arena in which to achieve. I am accustomed to the work of coming up in a new field and am thirsty for the opportunity to put my skills to work for you. Without taking risks we can never hope to change our lives. With this letter of intent I hope to change my reality by providing you with the highest quality of design work. I earn my keep through keeping my head down and my eyes and ears wide open. Good old fashion hard work is far from fashionable these days, but has consistently been an association with my name. If you require a team member who is used to pulling his weight and picking up slack, I am the man for the job.</p>
 
<p>In a field as fast paced as web design, the stagnant get left behind. In order to stay on top of our game we must never stop learning, and growing. We must all constantly progress. Once we stop growing, striving for that next achievement, we grow complacent, and we die. As humans we are constantly searching for the meaning of life. I have come to find two. We are on this planet for equal and opposite purposes. To learn as much as we can, and to have as much fun as we can. I have learned on my own and hope to continue developing with a production house as prestigious as yours. Furthermore, fun, for me, has always been linked to success. A position with your firm wraps everything together with growth and prosperity. An African proverb laid out the Essence of survival.</p>
<p>“Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning a lion wakes up, it knows it must outrun the gazelle or it will starve to death. It doesn’t matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle. When the sun comes up, you better start running.”</p>
<p>Let us run together. </p>

  <h1>Home</h1>
  <p>
  El mas aprendo el menor yo se
And since I can’t ever really know anything and it all seems just a bit futile I may as well just sit back and try to play
I was smacked in the face by the sizzling sun
And the only thing close enough to reach capable of cooling cool my tongue
Was some very cheap but owe so delicious rum
 
Faded quickly those distant memories of my mommas home
And that far off and ooooh the things that we would do when we were alone
 
Through the smoke of my cigarette and the haze of the line above
Rose my connection to home and the ones that I used to love
 
At home, I was protected by momma, never put on display never wanted for anything in my little shack by the bay. But in truth if I were to reflect, since the moment I could walk vie been running away. Searching for somebody anybody that body with whom I could sit down and talk
With you all in this place I have but a short time
And ill apologize in advance if it all doesn’t rhyme.
I’ll start off by saying that I’m far from a boss
Just a man with an opportunity to get a message across
 
Home has nothing to do with television clean sheets or a view of the bay
Ya bougey ass telephones or Walmart down the way
Home is about those people who wanna see you smile at the end of the day.
 
It’s a place which lets you come in and leave
To recharge with the sun and face head on a cool morning breeze
 
It’s an outpost a barrack a slab out of the rain
Which allows you to go out into the world and come back feeling spent happy and drained
In this big wide world all I know is that home is where my jacket hangs
 
I stand here in front and look back into my rear view mirror
I have a decent base tan and let’s be honest I’ve probably drank just a few too many beers
But I remember the beauties, those moments that pass too quickly by
And if I wasn’t honest with you know then shiiiit this would all be nothing but a lie
I have spoken the language and I have faced the suns attack
As I look tall out at my pack I know that I would be lucky to ever be back
  </p>

  <h6>Flow</h6>

  <p>
  As I sat and the sea water broke against the brick, so too broke an idea through my walls. We all will die, yet we all endeavor for a greater purpose; strive to find the meaning behind it all. But perhaps there is no plan, there is no game at which to win. Why trial Why tribulate? Our journey here is most probably nothing more than a happy accident. A serious of extraordinary events dictated your place in this time and space. We have been carried to the seat and strapped in. Is there any higher caller than to sit back relax an enjoy the ride?
As with any ride there will be highs and there will be lows. Search for those moments that keep your hands busy and your teeth showing. Work in the mediums that let your mind wash white and the minutes tick by without too much pain, maybe if your lucky a little bit of joy. It wont always be pleasant, giving up is the answer for some. Crawling into a hole and refusing to come out is all to easy
Food, Television, Bratty Kids, a rope, a loud band and quick bullet.
We find all these reasons to not exist. so many trivials and excuses to remove ourselves from our journey.
That is all we have… a Journey
We only have one trip around here. We are HUMAN BEINGS! In another billion years the molecule of our universe will never again arrange themselves in any form a magnificent as ours. Squeeze every drop of this silky smooth juice from life’s fruit. Fruit is constantly ageing. Growing soft and moldy. New trees must all be scouted. The juice will never come to you. Our only option. Try and enjoy the sqeeze. Try and find the flow that puts a smile on your face and lets the moments slip by. Just try and relieve the ache.
  </p>

  <h6>....</h6>
  <p>I can blame you and I do
Cuz you’re the type of person that aint never had a clue
You sit there and you watch while the time fly
And for more people every day it’s a struggle just to get by
We have to work, so we need gas
But the one cannot afford the other
Not when it’s all added to the medicine required by your mother
And the food and the clothes necessary to feed and cover your daughter
… And her brother
The food that you swallow used to serve as medicine
But now it’s better that it makes us sick
That way they can sell us bypasses and pepcidine
It is becoming impossible to find anything nutritious
Our forefathers had that but we traded up for …”riches”
We waste time clamoring for
Iphones, Headphones, speakers, and television sets
When we know that the labor required to buy us off as pets
Forces our neighbors across borders
To live in tragedy and horrors
As long as we have cheap clothes
And jobs that pay well enough to attend the parties he throws
We are entertained and don’t talk about the tough decisions
Like: “well do I choke in a sweat shop or do I cook this cocaine”?
Regardless of where you are or the God that you claim
The short end of the stick. WE ALL ARE THE SAME
Whether Bama, Mexico, India, or Iraq
The time is upon us for a grandiose attack
Every day the world is shrinking
We’re pushed closer and closer
Begin to understand your similarities. Gain Some Composure
Recognize Please Recognize!
Power is afraid of heights.
It pushes you down with its vicious bite
Their only goal is to keep themselves afloat.
But trust me their frightened of the power we can invoke.
Be wary, that without each other there is no value in you
You have no stool which permits you to stand above another
Link in Arm so we all can discover
As we soar ahead through time, there is not need to hover
Stagnate
Our branches can still grow. Our buds still flower
Everything we have, that has brought us this far has come from our mother
No we stand divorced from her
Pumping Toxins & Killing Trees
Taking her life blood Like it was all just for free
It isn’t
I warn you with the spirit of a bee
Poison the earth and not long shall you be
Weep for the Earth, Howl out for Humanity
But don’t look above for salvation
You need only look around
Look into the eyes of your fellow man
Recognize Appreciate
Together we shall band
See in him the same love that you reserve for you and yours
Pay no mind to the wars
Fought for rich me, Young boys tricked
By a sense of pride and very real fear
The world outside is good
To see you only need to peer……. Into your fellow human
We are all from this earth. The differences between us were created to keep us down. God created languages to prevent us from reaching his level. Doesn’t that just scream at you? Abandon God & Soar. Abandon our corrupt governments & religions, your individualistic nationalities and your ignorant prejudices. Come forth and see how high we can climb. There is no difference between us. We are no different than the swimming anemone. We must band together and take hold of every opportunity.
So No I don’t care if you voted for Obama or Romney. Just wake the fuck up, and come outside. There are a lot people at this party. We are all common and we are all good. Most of us are real hungry. Get out of bed, get dressed come meet me at this table.</p>

<h6>I run</h6>
<p>A weight on my shoulders. I stumble forward like a slack jawed bison being worked to death. Dragging plow through the blistering summer desert. His tongue hangs loose and his eyes bulge out of his head.
A vice squeezes my chest. Every breath more labored and painful than the one before. A stabbing pain inside. If I could only move the thorn, but my calves have been replaced with black spheres of scorching lead, and my ankles splintered marbles of glass.
But my mind is awash with bliss, true nirvana. As my thoughts fall by the wayside and my troubles fail to keep up. I go blank as a flow begins to roll. Consciousness joins a higher order as I fly above the pain in my body, above the strife in our world.
I run to increase my worth. I run to atone for my atrocities. I run to know my earth. To taste my mornings and experience my nights. I run to survey my world and validate my lifestyle. I run to feel as though have participated, to tie myself as one with my planet.
I run to be alone and I run to be united. To escape the drowning loneliness. I run for my own greed and my own pride, to keep sloth and gluttony at an arm’s length. I run to bury my wrath and to keep it bubbling up to the surface. I run to snake my lust and to set fires in others. I run to inspire envy in and amongst my brothers. I run for the freeing moment of absolute clarity.
The pain builds continues to climb as the black-top beats me from below. I forge forward. I know it can only hurt so much. My heart pumps for I feel so alive. I head south with the sun on my back. I must commit to the pain after it has had its way with me I am free. Like a bird. My heart, my lungs my throat opens up. The elements of earth and the essence of humanity wash into me. My legs stretch out for distances never before reached. I run for a high tide on a clear summer morning. I run for a thunderstorm on a full moon night. I run for my heart and its eternally burning guiding inner light.
I run its one hell of a drug.</p>

<h6>giving Up</h6>
<p>Today I saw a woman in the bread line. Child clutching her pinky finger, afraid of the loud and busy world outside. Two more tugged at her worn skirt , like suckling pigs.
The youngest of the children, with the roundest head and the biggest bottom, weighed down on her forearm.
I watched as he drooled over his hands and his chin. The joints in her arm bulged with the strain. Her eyes were dark, sunken glazed over, and void of feeling. Her arm seemed as though it might snap as she winced with the pain.
Her brow was slanted, wrinkled and it stuck out much too far with her scowl. She shook loose her one free hand and fumbled with the tongs trying to fill their bellies. Was her own hunger on her mind? She desperately needed to eat.
I’ve never seen such emptiness on the face of a child, but all too often carved into the faces of our mothers. When does this pain take priority? Biologically we are driven to replace ourselves. No longer does the fate of humanity lie in the fertility of our species. We have evolved out of nature. Must we starve ourselves in our later years, care too much for the mouths of too many others?
What causes us to stop running our own race? Give up so far before the finish line. Our span of our reach is limitless, but instead we endeavor to push another forward. Pump out a unit and hope it can drudge into the distant beyond.
We are tubes that put things in at one end and put them out at another. this wares us out an inevitably we find ways of making other tubes. Suddenly we focus more on what are children put in and put out. No longer do we care for optimizing our own processes, but instead we stifle and choke.
Push the Young. Hurl them Further than we were able to go ourselves.
A trigger flips. we no loner climb. We sit and we watch. When did life become a spectator sport? When do we take ourselves out of the equation?
From the primordial swamp life has always protected itself. never stayed to long in any one arranging of atoms. It always finds a way to grow, change, evolve, and flow through time. Our species abuses the ecological system. Our role has become detrimental. yet still be pump out unit after unit. Taking a break seems logical.
Concentrate of personal Evolution. The Future is not always Better

<h6>traditional contention: A history of cannabis and south carolina </h6>
<p>Cannabis policy crashed into the S.C. House of Representatives on Tuesday. Republican, Michael Pitts, boldly followed up on previous cannabis legislation attempts. His bill, HB3117 Controlled Substance Offenses and Penalties, would add S.C. to the list of states who have decriminalized cannabis. As a former officer with the Greenville Police, Pitts is excited for the opportunity to distribute resources for the state’s law enforcement. In an interview before the House session, Pitts stated, “This is not an issue on which we should be wasting time and man power; cannabis is not the problem it is accused of being.” S.C. is far from ahead of the curve. According to publications from the nation’s House of Representatives, more than 32 states have legitimized cannabis to one level or another.
To most people in this day and age, arguing the social and medicinal benefits of cannabis, is redundant. The issue laid at the feet of representatives is whether or not to catch up, and stand up for South Carolinians. The facts line up on one side opposed to recent conservative tradition; Furthermore, South Carolinians are not most people.
Popular rhetoric in the Palmetto State has always reflected the value of personal liberty, never favoring governance from above. For better or worse, history speaks for itself. South Carolina became the first Republic in North America, on March 26, 1776, adopting the Constitution of South Carolina and declaring independence from Great Britain months before any other colonies followed suit. The state was also the first to succeed from the Union during the Civil War. In modern times, South Carolina adamantly opposed federal ordinances dealing with Civil Rights and the Affordable Health Care Act, never failing to march to its own drummer, however off beat it might be.
Historic acts of rebellion have given way to staunch opposition against social justice issues. Through and through, South Carolina has remained unbending and stubborn. Charleston, South Carolina’s Holy City, is known for its attitude, and for it’s saying, “Charlestonians lower their colors for no one.” This pride and sense of tradition, seldom comparable to the rest of the U.S., may attest to South Carolina’s current “stiffness”, shall we say.
In the modern era, the state avoids progressive social issues. Relics remain, sunk into the S.C. soil. The Confederate Flag, placed on the state capitol in 1962, in opposition to the national desegregation of schools, remained on the Capitol building until 2000. Even then, the flag only traveled as far as the Capitol’s front lawn. Nevertheless, popular social trends and liberties still collide with and take hold in the state. Readers will be reminded, South Carolina took its time, but indeed, became the 35th state to support marriage equality for the LGBT community. This is the slow and hesitant environment into which cannabis legislation returns to the House.
Cannabis policy reform is no longer a fringe issue in the U.S. and it may seem as though South Carolina is a bit behind the ball. However, South Carolina is no stranger to cannabis legislation. Believe it or not, the state has allowed for medicinal cannabis since 1982, it just hasn’t been funded. State policy has allowed for Cannabis Research, even though, neither, the state, nor DHEC were interested “pickin’ up the check” for the then relatively obscure social and medicinal issue.
Fast-forward more than two decades and this outdated loophole, and obstruction to personal liberty has resulted in the mandatory incarceration of tens of thousands of South Carolinians. Currently, South Carolina incarcerates 1st time offenders for 30 days and up to a year the second time around. This strain on the judicial system is the motive behind House Bill 3117. The bill is to be placed before the House Tuesday, January 13th. If passed, South Carolina will join North Carolina and 16 other states, which have specifically decriminalized cannabis.
A year ago, S.C. had even bolder hopes. Representative Todd Rutherford has previously brought cannabis before the house. Last Year, Rutherford wrote the Put Patients First Act, giving health care professionals liberty to prescribe cannabis to their patients. The Put Patients First Act, HB3140, was appointed to South Carolina’s Judiciary Committee and there it currently remains. The Bill outlines and funds a full and comprehensive Medicinal Cannabis policy for S.C. HB3140 describes some of the many benefits of medicinal cannabis, supported by hard science. These include treatment for cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, severe pain, nausea, muscle spasms and multiple sclerosis, and new research is peer reviewed and supported every day.  Cannabis is safe for an expectant mother, young children, and has yet to have been documented causing an allergic reaction. Rutherford is passionate about the health care of his electorate and doesn’t believe policy should stand between patients and doctors when it comes to finding a cure. Even the smallest amount of critical research identifies cannabis as just that, a cure.
Representative Pitts asked, “Why would you want to keep medicine out of the hands of patients?” Todd Rutherford is the primary co-sponsor for HB117, and this shows support for cannabis stretches across the aisle. However, Pitts continues, “The real trouble comes with the power of small town police to stumble across a roach or a seed and mark someone’s future for life. Not even habitual cannabis users create the sort of social problems we see reflected in meth, heroine or even alcohol. Drug records limit job opportunity and licensing abilities. A helpful plant shouldn’t ruin someone’s life.” The argument for cannabis as harmless has risen and fallen in the public eye, and evidence for the help it provides continues to grow at a staggering pace. Yet S.C. to date continues to incarcerate, and this is what HB3117 attempts to halt.
The bill, as written, specifically outlines penalties for those found in possession of cannabis. New laws will allow for the possession of up to an ounce of the plant to be met with a citation of no more than $200 for first time offenders and no more than $1000 for second time offenders. The bill also includes a line stating, “A person issued a citation must not be taken into custody or arrested for such a violation. The bill itself cites minor possession arrests as accounting for 91% of all marijuana related arrests in the state. Statistics like these are common throughout the nation but ring more severe in a state with already limited resources. The bill continues on, in many ways simply seeking to free up law enforcement assets.
Prisons overcrowded with nonviolent offenders are commonplace today in the U.S. The Federal Bureau of Prisons boasts a population of over 210,000 inmates, more than 97,000 of those being nonviolent drug offenders. However, completely disregarding federal statistics, the cannabis issue remains a pertinent one in South Carolina. The authors of House Bill 3117 personally rank South Carolina as 5th in the nation for violent crimes. Furthermore, in 2014, South Carolina fell from 1st to 2nd in women’s deaths due to domestic violence. The bill declares, “Marijuana possession arrests are made at the expense of preventing and solving these violent crimes,” hence the call for decriminalization. The bill plainly cries out, “South Carolina must reform its criminal penalties for marijuana possession to free up necessary time and money to go after violent criminals who cause true havoc and loss of life in our Communities.” In addition to cross party sponsorship by Rutherford and Pitts, the bill is sponsored by Deborah Long [R], Justin Bamberg [D], and Gilda Cobb-Hunter [D].
The two pronged approach provided by the two bills will only increase the likelihood of S.C benefitting from cannabis legislation, whether through increased law enforcement resources due to decriminalization, tax dollars and patient care due to a medicinal policy, or both. Wayne Borders, President and acting Executive Director of Columbia S.C.’s NORML chapter spoke regarding the two bills. “I think it’s past time for such measures. I’m looking forward to making sure a lot of citizens become aware of both bills and ask that their legislators support both,” said borders, and he may just have the clout to follow through on such promises. Borders is personally backed by a full staff here in South Carolina and The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws is a nationally recognized Political Action Committee. “However”, Borders warns, “3117 shouldn’t be taken as a substitute for the Put Patients First Act. Decriminalization, in fact, is a great complement to a medicinal law and would only make it more effective. Patients in South Carolina have been waiting a long time for Medicinal Cannabis Laws.”
Representative Pitts is also hopeful that the two bills will work together. “If I can get mine through then Todd’s bill should be a no brainer” Pitts exclaimed. Cannabis continues to creep all around the U.S. and those institutions, which have taken advantage, continue to benefit. Whether it be through resource redistribution, tax dollars flowing, or a rejuvenation of an agribusiness to an agriculture state, South Carolina stands to come out ahead. Increasingly, it is becoming obvious that to argue the particulars of this net benefit would be an exercise in futility and redundancy. As men like Pitts and Rutherford continue to fight, others will become all the more aware. Pitts explained his hopefulness for the bill, “Todd is a hard-working well connected man, who works tirelessly on this issue and I have spent a lifetime around the consequences of the War on Drugs. Together we carry a wealth of experience and knowledge, and I hope people will listen.” The tireless effort of Legislators like Todd Rutherford and Mike Pitts make it impossible to deny the inherit benefits accompanied by favorable Cannabis Legislation. The question ahead of all South Carolinians is whether or not they choose to uphold their pride and traditions, or take a leap forward for the liberty and health of their society.</p>

<h6>Corporate Sponsors Migrant Labor </h6>
<p>In the Palmetto State, one would be hard pressed to find someone unaware of the Kiawah Island Golf Resort. Its high class levels of service and sophistication have made it the standard for opulence in the Southeast. Respectfully, a majority of those who engage in the “bougieness” on Kiawah Island belong to a very slim and moneyed sector of the American population. On the other hand, the majority of the Resort staff during the peak operating season is made up a population so prideful and hungry for employment that they travel across oceans to work in our hotels, without citizenship. The United States offers special H2B visas to accommodate this type of labor under the strictest of circumstances. These visas are a necessity in the American economy, because not only do immigrants and their families benefit from the jobs held in the United States, but the Resort and others like it also depend on this labor. On rare and special occasions the Kiawah Island Gold Resort offers opportunities to peek behind the veil, and explore the dependency between these two worlds. In a society plagued by a disappearance of the middle class and diverging economic status, this type of case study is essential. However, don’t be upset if on a trip it is difficult to get a statement on Worker’s Rights; the hotel is much more interested in discussing its amenities.
The Resort sits on Kiawah Island, a 10 mile long stretch of beach situated about 30 miles south west of Charleston S.C. Currently the island is completely privatized. The majority of the land is owned by the Golf Resort itself, the remaining divvied up by private landowners for millions of dollars to the acre. Our guide was an HR rep, fresh off maternity leave sporting a diamond wedding ring with such opulence that the health of her joints could have been a concern. Her counterpart, a fellow college graduate from the state of S.C. followed suit in shading the best overall image for the Kiawah Island Resort and their labor practices as well.
The visit was intended to start with a brief tour and a history of the island. Afterwards, following a quick coffee and fruit snack, visitors are offered the opportunity to Q&A with the Resort’s foreign workers, with purposes of building an idea of the conditions under which H2B workers live.
The tour around the Kiawah Resort was Diamond studded and wrapped in gold. The tour group was initially informed that it was best to keep speech down to a whisper and if possible, it was even better to refrain from noise at all. Better that way to not disturb the guests. Let sleeping dogs lie, as they say. Observers became very familiar with the largest recreation center in the state and the five star dining available to the public; if it could be afforded. Admittedly, our HR tour guide had only been able to squeeze out one dining experience during her employment. The group was permitted to look inside the Ocean Room restaurant, but only from a far and behind a locked door. But of course, the room does cost $20,000 to rent out. The group was informed of tunnels which ran under the hotel. This allowed clock work to keep spinning without guests having to actually see hotel staffers, too often. Looking at staff can be so drab, am I right?
The historical tour contained no information of the colonization of the island or the population who lived on Kiawah before the Resort purchased all of the land. No information on how the entire island was privatized, or the ecological effect all the golf courses have on the island. The group was informed that the entire resort is only 10 years old, which technically corresponds to the creation of the housing bubble and the beginning of W’s second term in ’04 which led to the economic collapse in ’08, but no mention was made to that coincidence either. The group was informed however, that full-time employees can get 40% off spa treatments, and that Forbes gave the hotel a 4-star rating!!! The group was offered a few secrets as to the hotel’s construction. Under the floor boards in the main lobby rests permanently $2,000 worth of change. How else would you get that quintessential creak in the floor of an Antiquated Southern Mansion? The Hotel is also damn near bomb proof. Fire walls exist to cut the hotel into five separate chambers in case of disaster “for the purposes of protecting our guests,……oh yea and the employees too.”
Finally, the group was awarded the opportunity to Q&A with the H2B workers both of whom were from Jamaica. Both H2B workers returned to the island annually and had worked their way up the migrant ladder. It may be impossible to find Americans who speak about their jobs with more reverence than these immigrants to this country. The opportunity to wake up in the morning, serve guests and create lifelong memories, fills the H2B workers with a stern sense of dedication and pride that runs deep. These feelings of honor are plain and evident in their speech. O.T. described the opportunity as a win-win and a lose-lose. As an H2B worker he is able to provide more completely an education and a lifestyle for his daughter and family back in Jamaica. However, this opportunity also forced him to be away from her for nine months out of the year. The white HR guide took it upon herself to do a majority of the talking. She discussed how it was difficult for the hotel to find domestic workers to fill the job positions that the H2B workers occupied. Workers had to be content with no pension, benefits, or health insurance. The wages are far from what is required to live anywhere near Kiawah so a hefty commute is also necessary. Taking into account the working conditions provided by the hotel, who better to fill the position than a laborer with immigrant status grateful for the opportunity to toil in the Resort and send a majority of their earnings back to their home countries? No one. The H2B workers were a perfect fit.
A little inquiry got into the base discussion of benefits and pay scales offered by the hotel. Full time workers, were anyone who worked an annual amount of hours which equated to more than 32 when divided by the 52 weeks in the year. This status came along with health insurance, paid vacation, reduced rates at the hotel, maternity leave, sick leave, and other health benefits. Part time workers, who by the word of the HR guide, tend to work much more than 32 hours in a week but for only nine month out of the year, and receive none of these benefits. Apparently the hotel doesn’t realize that nine months is a vast majority of the year, and that 32 is a lot closer to full time than part time. In the three months that H2B employees are not working for the Kiawah Island resort it is necessary for them to return home, on their own dime, and begin the whole expensive and time consuming process over again. The only thing keeping the H2B workers away from Kiawah are family disasters and the stoned and somber look in the eyes the guests reveled the true potential of this possibility.
The HR guide admitted that a majority of her efforts went to bringing in these H2B workers. And it would be a much smaller “headache” if she had the ability to hire domestically. But with the economic exploitation of foreign countries by the United States, huge labor pools exist to fill positions deemed unworthy of thought by Americans. Social Welfare is a huge help. As long as U.S. Americans continue to devalue labor the exploitation of workers will continue as the race-to-the-bottom presses on. MLK said “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” and the conditions to which we subject migrant laborers in the states is nothing if not a mirror of the conditions for which we hope ourselves.
The question I would like to have answered is, taking into account the pride, dedication, and multi-linguistic skill of the H2B part time employees, not exhibited by the full-time counterparts, Who is really essential in this equation? And who is really expendable?  </p>
